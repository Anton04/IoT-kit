IoT-kit
===================

This is a generic tool that I envision that will help me deal with sensor data in a more efficient way. 

The idea is to define multidimentional datafeeds which partial data onedimetional data streams could originate from different sources and make it simple to playaround with these and manipulate data through the python pandas library.
